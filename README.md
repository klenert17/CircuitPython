### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.

## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code

```python
# Kathryn Lenert
# LCD Button Python
# This code counts the time the button is pressed and shows whether its up or down

import board
import time
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

btn = DigitalInOut(board.D2)
btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D7)

btn.pull = Pull.UP
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT
btn2.pull = Pull.UP
# some LCDs are 0x3f... some are 0x27.

cur_state = True
prev_state = True
cur_state2 = True

buttonPress = 0

while True:
    while btn2.value == False:
        cur_state = btn.value
        if cur_state != prev_state:
            if not cur_state:
                buttonPress = buttonPress + 1
                lcd.clear()
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0)
                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))
                time.sleep(0.005)

                lcd.clear()
                lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0)
                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))

                lcd.print(str(buttonPress))
        prev_state2 = cur_state2
